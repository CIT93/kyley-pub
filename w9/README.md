localStorage:

With localStorage still being somewhat of a new concept for us my knowledge and understanding is very limited. From viewing the video and reading the links provide I learned that a localStorage is a storage system for data that has been entered to be saved in order to be called back on at a later time point. You can set variables to retained saved data in order to call back upon those variables at a later time instead of needing to re-enter the data everytime.

Serialization:

My understanding of serialization is that the data saved can be condensed in a more suitable form to be transfered. This can be taking multiple saved data and converting them into a string or array that can be pulled together as a grouping. This goes hand in hand with JSON string since you can serialize using JSON.stringify() and then later do the opposite to signify a variable with the values saved in the localStorage either alone or one serialized with JSON.
