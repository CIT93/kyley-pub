The explaination of return functions and functions as a a whole I understood well. I am not too confused on how a functions works, but more so can be stumped because the possibilites of what you can do within a function is a lot. I understand function and return functions well. Additionally the part where if you want to use the return value you must set up a const variable to hold the information.
