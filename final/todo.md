1. the first thing that I would like to do for my Decision App is that I would like to add a background wallpaper instead of having a blank background color. I believe this will make it more lively and enjoyable for other users to see when they mess with the app.

2. The second thing I would like to add to the Decision App is implementing async code to render a little message or emoji for users that stay on my webpage longer than just entering in their information.

3. Lastly I would like to mess with the style to change how the webpage looks. Instead of having it look very basic.
